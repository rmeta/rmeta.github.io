                    <h3>Made to be Remade Initiatives: Design for Reusability amid Product Innovations in a Circular Economy</h3>
                    <p><strong>Submitted to:</strong> Production and Operations Management</p>
                    <p><strong>Guide:</strong> Amir Ardestani-Jaafari & Shumail Mazahir</p>
                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> The growing strain on natural resources has driven firms to adopt circular economy initiatives aimed at reducing reliance on virgin materials. Companies like Adidas, H&amp;M, and IKEA are at the forefront of <em>Made to be Remade</em> initiatives, recovering materials and components from post-use products for new production. However, wider adoption of these initiatives faces challenges from design changes and product innovations that can inhibit the reuse of components and parts. This paper presents a stylized steady-state model of a monopolistic firm to explore the balance between product reusability and innovation within <em>Made to be Remade</em> initiatives. The model incorporates sustainability-conscious consumers and mandatory collection targets. Our findings highlight two key forces shaping environmental outcomes: (i) component extraction and substitution, which reduce reliance on virgin resources, and (ii) market expansion or contraction, which can counteract the environmental benefits of circularity. We demonstrate that a strategic balance between innovation and reusability can improve environmental outcomes. Policymakers can support this through collection targets and campaigns that influence consumer perceptions of reusability. However, such interventions also risk unintended market expansion, potentially diluting reusability benefits. Effective policy requires a deep understanding of industry dynamics and careful calibration of interventions.</p>

                    <h3>Analytical Techniques for Understanding and Enhancing Consumer Sustainability Behaviour</h3>
                    <p><strong>To be submitted to:</strong> Journal of Operations Management</p>
                    <p><strong>Guide:</strong> Amir Ardestani-Jaafari & Eric Li</p>
                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> <p>Awareness of environmental issues has spurred a greater interest in sustainable practices, highlighting the need for in-depth studies on consumer preferences and behaviors. This research investigates consumer behaviors related to sustainable practices and eco-friendly product purchases, evaluating various influencing factors. It seeks to determine which sustainability initiatives, like take-back programs, are most effective in motivating consumer participation. Initially, the study identifies two distinct groups of well-known brands from a survey of more than 200 respondents, analyzing the primary factors that differentiate these groups to determine which is more synonymous with sustainability. Subsequently, it calculates sustainability scores for each participant to identify the crucial sustainable initiatives and motivators for eco-conscious behavior, employing classification techniques such as logistic regression and Support Vector Machines (SVM). The methodology also includes association rule mining, bootstrap simulation, decision trees, cross-tabulation, and robustness checks. This multifaceted approach enables predictions about customer engagement in sustainability initiatives and categorizes respondents accordingly. Additionally, robust and integer optimization techniques are utilized to minimize noise and ensure consistency between human preferences and the data utilized.</p>

                    <p><strong>Conference:</strong> CSANS 2022, Tehran, Iran</p>
                    <p><strong>Guide:</strong> Ehsan Maani-Miandoab</p>
                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> The main purpose of this paper is to analyze the SEIR dynamical model of information propagation in online social networks. Existing research recognizes the behavior of the system over time and under certain circumstances, but this does not provide a deep understanding of the system. In this paper, the global dynamics are analyzed by calculating the exact equilibrium points and verifying their stability. Phase diagrams and time responses are presented to show the system's behavior for different constant coefficients. Additionally, by plotting basin of attraction graphs, the stability of each fixed point is further examined. These graphs illustrate how changes in parameters affect the system and alter the stability of equilibrium points. The results reveal that information propagation heavily depends on the system's parameters, and by controlling these parameters, the system's behavior can be regulated.</p>

                    <h3>An Asymmetric Supercapacitor Using PANI as the Positive Electrode and Ti3C2Tx/PANI as the Negative Electrode</h3>
                    <p><strong>Conference:</strong> 11th International Conference on Science and Nanotechnology Development, 2023, Hungary</p>
                    <p><strong>Guide:</strong> Somayeh Mohammadi</p>
                    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Herein, an asymmetric supercapacitor based on Polyaniline (PANI) as the positive electrode and MXene/PANI as the negative electrode was developed. Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub> MXene shows its highest specific capacitance in the negative voltage window, while PANI exhibits its highest specific capacitance in the positive voltage window. Thus, Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub> and PANI are suitable as the negative and positive electrodes in an asymmetric capacitor, respectively. To increase the active surface area of MXene layers, PANI was added to the MXene layers using magnetic stirring. Two different MXene/PANI ratios (90:10 and 80:20) were examined. The synergistic effect of Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub> MXene and PANI leads to an increase in specific capacitance from 33 F/g in pristine MXene to 77 F/g and 108 F/g in MXene/PANI composites with ratios of 90:10 and 80:20, respectively. Since the MXene/PANI electrode with the ratio of 80:20 has the highest specific capacitance, it was used as the negative electrode in the asymmetric supercapacitor. The specific capacitance of the asymmetric configuration using the MXene/PANI composite with a ratio of 80:20 as the negative electrode and PANI as the positive electrode was 96 F/g at the scan rate of 2 mV/s.</p>
